    WarpSans is the standard OS/2 bitmap font used as the main UI font in
    recent OS/2 versions but this format is not supported by FreeType.
    There is a TTF replacement for it created by Alex Taylor called
    Workplace Sans (with hinting and nice bitmaps for certain sizes).

      Workplace Sans provides nice embedded bitmaps for small glyph sizes
      to mimic WarpSans appearance 1 to 1. Make sure they are enabled.
      Note that hinting is also a must to keep appearance identical.
